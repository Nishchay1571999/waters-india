          <h2>What is MBBR Technology?</h2>
          <p>
            The <strong>MBBR Technology</strong> is a state-of-the-art solution for wastewater treatment, known for its
            <strong> efficiency</strong>, <strong>flexibility</strong>, and <strong>low operational costs</strong>. Using specially designed biofilm carriers, the MBBR process
            increases the surface area for bacterial growth, which helps in breaking down pollutants and achieving higher quality water output.
