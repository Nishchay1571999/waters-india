          <h2>What is an FFTR System?</h2>
          <p>
            FFTR systems combine multiple processes—flocculation, filtration, and total removal—to effectively treat water. 
            <strong>Flocculation</strong> gathers fine particles into larger clumps, which are then removed through <strong>filtration</strong>, 
            resulting in water that is free from contaminants and ready for use.
