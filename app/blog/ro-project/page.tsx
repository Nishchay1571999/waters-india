          <h2>Understanding RO Water Purification</h2>
          <p>
            Reverse Osmosis (RO) is a water purification technology that removes contaminants and impurities, including heavy metals, chemicals, and pathogens. 
            This process provides <strong>pure, filtered water</strong> that is not only safe to drink but also enhances the taste and quality of the water used for cooking and other household needs.
