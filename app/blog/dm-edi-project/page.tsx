          <h2>What is DM EDI?</h2>
          <p>
            DM EDI combines deionization with electrodeionization to produce ultrapure water. This process removes ions and other impurities 
            without the need for chemical regeneration, making it a <strong>continuous and eco-friendly</strong> solution for water purification.
